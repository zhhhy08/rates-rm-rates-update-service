# htz-base-repository-template

This template provides a basic structure and a set of files commonly used in software projects. This setup is flexible and can be used as a starting point for many types of projects, regardless of the programming language or platform you're working with.

## Add Pipeline

If at any stage this repository is connected to a pipeline, add a link to the pipeline to this README.

If this repository needs to be connected to a new pipeline, then contact Dev Ops team

## Structure of This Template

Here is a brief overview of what's included:

1. **.gitignore**: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. This is often used to exclude temporary or non-source files from the repository.

2. **Makefile**: This file is used by the `make` utility to manage build processes. It's a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks such as compiling code, running tests, and more.

3. **CODEOWNERS**: This file is used to define individuals or teams who are responsible for code in a repository. They will be automatically requested for review whenever a pull request touches the code they own.

4. **README.md**: You're reading it right now! Every repository should have a README file to tell others why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. This is often the first file a visitor will see, so it's a good place to summarize everything important.

## How to Use This Template

You can create a new repository with the same structure and files as this one by clicking the "Use this template" (htz-base-repository-template) button at the top of this repository's page.

Fill in the name, description, and privacy settings for your new repository, then click "Create repository from template".

Now you're ready to start your project! Remember to update the files with information and commands relevant to your project.
